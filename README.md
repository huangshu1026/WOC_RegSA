# Wisdom of Crowds: Regularized Weighting Method
This repository contains data and R code for replicating simulations, data application,
tables and figures described in the working paper "A Regularized Weighting Model of 
Judgment Aggregation‚Äù authored by Shu Huang, Russell Golman, and Stephen B. Broomell. 

## How to use
1. Clone this repository to your local computer
2. For each script to run, be sure to change the working directory in each script (searching "setwd()")

## algorithm
The file "WeightingModels.R" contains all related weighting models mentioned in the paper. 

## simulation
The file "simulation.R" contains the sample code for the simulation by using the bootstrapped judgments based on the sample data "inf_filtered.csv" and "unemp_filtered.csv".

## data application 
The file "data_application.R" contains the sample code for analyzing all empirical datasets used in the working paper. Please ask authors for the raw data if needed. 

## results_analysis
The file "result analysis.R" contains the sample code for obtaining all tables and figures by using files in the "results" forlder.
